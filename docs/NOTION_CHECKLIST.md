# Skillstream Academy — Development Checklist

Single-academy learning platform. Job: connect enrollment, course access, completion, and a publicly verifiable credential.

**Journey:** Enroll → Learn → Get certified

**Integrations**
- Enrollment → LMS access — Live
- Completion → Certificate — Live
- Lesson chatbot — Live. Answers a student’s lesson question from that course’s lesson text only, using GPT-6 Luna. If the lessons do not contain the answer, it says so and stops. It does not send the question to the instructor.

**Rule:** Planned work stays labeled Planned. Do not ship UI that looks finished if it is not wired.

# System list

## Roles
- Student — browse catalog, enroll, complete lessons, share a certificate
- Instructor — author modules/lessons, publish, view roster/progress
- Admin — placeholder now; review, users, and system health later
- Public — verify a certificate by reference with no login

## Data model
- Identity — users, user_sessions
- Learning — courses, course_modules, lessons, enrollments, lms_accounts, lesson_progress
- Credential — certificates
- AI — ai_conversations, ai_messages. Answers come from lesson text. The escalations rows are the earlier question box, not the chatbot.
- Comms — notifications
- Ops — integration_events, audit_logs

## Already working
- Role login (student, instructor, admin)
- Passwords are bcrypt hashes. The session cookie is signed, expires in 7 days, and logout revokes it.
- Instructor creates a course, modules, and lessons, then submits the draft for review. An admin publishes it.
- Student catalog and enrollment
- LMS account created on enroll; course is active only after access is provisioned
- Student provisioning states: in progress, failed, and player blocked until access is ready
- Lesson player with progress
- Completing all lessons marks enrollment completed
- Certificate issued on completion. The student and the public verify page can download a PDF of that record.
- Public /verify by reference
- Basic instructor roster
- Landing page
- Public footer on the landing page, sign-in, and verify: “Skillstream Academy · Enroll, learn, and verify a certificate,” a link to /verify, and © 2026. It does not say “academic project” or “no real student data,” because the site is deployed.
- Confirm-before dialog + after-success notice on every live mutating action
- Instructor edit, delete, and reorder for courses, modules, and lessons
- Instructor lesson type, reading/video URL, duration, and quiz prompt
- Completeness checklist before publish (API rejects incomplete)
- Archive course without deleting enrollments
- Integration events for LMS provision and certificate issue (retries Planned)
- Instructor roster last activity, needs-attention, and student detail
- Instructor can revoke a certificate; public verify still finds the reference and shows it as revoked
- Student catalog title search
- Lesson chatbot on an enrolled course. GPT-6 Luna answers from that course’s lesson text. If the lessons do not contain the answer, it says so and stops.
- Instructor can create a draft course from a PDF. The draft has modules and lessons from that PDF text. It stays private until the instructor submits it and an admin publishes it.
- An instructor submits a draft for review. An admin publishes it or sends it back with feedback.

# Phase 0 — Foundations

- [x] Product purpose: enroll → learn → certify, public verification
- [x] ERD + entity spec for V1 (single academy, one instructor per course)
- [ ] Sign-off on ERD
- [ ] Confirm one active enrollment per student per course
- [ ] Define PII / data-retention period
- [ ] Define max integration-event retries
- [ ] Decide certificate tamper-evidence (signed record + public lookup)
- [ ] Decide if external_lms_id is used in V1 or reserved

---

# Phase 1 — Core product path

Keep this path real. A student must be able to enroll, finish lessons, and verify a certificate without editing seed data.

## 1.1 Student enrollment
- [x] Enroll in a published course
- [x] Create linked lms_accounts on enroll
- [x] Block duplicate open enrollments
- [x] Student sees the course as active after enroll
- [x] Confirm enrollment before it runs; success banner after
- [x] Enroll starts at confirmed and becomes active only after LMS provision
- [x] Provisioning-in-progress UI state
- [x] Provisioning-failed UI state
- [x] Emit enrollment.confirmed into integration_events

## 1.2 Student course player
- [x] Module navigation + lesson body
- [x] Persist lesson_progress (in_progress / completed)
- [x] Completing the last lesson sets enrollment to completed
- [x] Confirm before marking a lesson complete; success banner after
- [x] Quiz grading. The instructor marks the correct choice. A wrong choice does not complete the lesson. A right choice records 100.
- [ ] Assignment scoring. Submitting an assignment still records 100. There is no file upload.
- [x] Video, quiz, and assignment types in authoring
- [x] Lesson duration and content URL/body in authoring

## 1.3 Certificates
- [x] Issue certificate only when enrollment is completed
- [x] Server-generated reference (SSA-YYYY-XXXXXX)
- [x] Student certificate list + detail
- [x] Public /verify with no login
- [x] Confirm before looking up a reference; result page is the after-confirm
- [x] Copy reference confirms with “Copied”
- [x] PDF file. `file_url` points at `/api/certificates/...`, which downloads a PDF of the saved record. A revoked certificate’s PDF says revoked.
- [x] Revoke / verification_status = revoked
- [x] Emit enrollment.completed into integration_events

## 1.4 Authentication
- [x] Role login + role-based route protection
- [x] Logout
- [x] Confirm before sign in and log out; success banners after
- [x] Hash passwords (bcrypt). `store.json` stores `passwordHash`, not the password.
- [x] Signed, expiring sessions (`user_sessions`, 7 days)
- [x] Revoke session on logout
- [ ] Password recovery
- [x] Remove plaintext credentials from data/store.json
- [x] Session cookie is signed. Editing the role or user id makes it invalid.

Done when: role access cannot be changed by editing a cookie.

## 1.5 Database
- [x] JSON file store (data/store.json) for local demo
- [ ] Relational DB matching the approved ERD
- [ ] Versioned migrations
- [ ] Seed data (demo student / instructor / admin + sample course)
- [ ] Concurrent writes that do not overwrite courses/modules/lessons

Done when: two simultaneous edits cannot clobber each other.

# Phase 2 — Instructor and admin workflow

## 2.1 Course authoring
- [x] Create course (draft)
- [x] Add modules and lessons
- [x] Submit for review from the course page. The instructor cannot set the course to published.
- [x] Checklist blocks submit when required items are missing
- [x] Confirm before create / add module / add lesson / submit / return to draft
- [x] Success notice after those mutations
- [x] Edit course title and description
- [x] Edit / delete modules and lessons
- [x] Delete course (blocked when enrollments exist)
- [x] Lesson type, content URL/body, duration, quiz prompt/choices
- [x] Reorder modules/lessons (up/down, sequence_order)
- [x] Explicit save confirmation (“Saved”)
- [x] Completeness checklist before publish
- [x] Archive course without deleting enrollments
- [x] Create a draft course from a PDF (modules and lessons; stays private until an admin publishes it)

## 2.2 Admin course review
- [x] Submit for review
- [x] Approve / return with feedback
- [ ] Archive and reassign instructor
- [x] Review state separate from public draft | published | archived
- [x] An admin publishes a submitted course. An instructor cannot publish it directly.

## 2.3 Roster and progress
- [x] List enrolled students per course
- [x] Progress % and certificate reference
- [x] Last activity timestamp
- [x] Needs-attention filter
- [x] Student detail view

## 2.4 Lesson chatbot
The chatbot answers a student’s question about a lesson. The knowledge base is that course’s lessons only:

- Reading: the lesson text
- Quiz: the prompt and choices
- Video: a link only, so there is no transcript to answer from

It does not use the instructor, the escalation inbox, or anything outside that course. If the lessons do not contain the answer, the chatbot says so and stops.

- [x] Course chat thread: the student’s question, then the assistant reply
- [x] Save the question on ai_conversations and ai_messages
- [x] Answer only from that course’s lesson text
- [x] If the lessons do not contain the answer, say so and stop
- [x] Do not create an instructor escalation for a lesson question
- [x] GPT-6 Luna answers on the server. If the key is missing or the call fails, the question stays saved and the reply stays empty.

The instructor Escalations page is removed. Lesson questions stay on the course.

## 2.5 Interaction feedback
- [x] Confirm dialog before every live mutating action
- [x] Success notice after every live mutating action
- [x] Route-level loading
- [ ] Retry on network/server failure
- [x] Confirm before delete for a course, module, or lesson

---

# Phase 3 — Events and notifications

## 3.1 Integration events
- [x] Write enrollment.confirmed and enrollment.completed
- [x] Status: pending | processing | succeeded | failed
- [ ] Retry with backoff + retry_count / last_error
- [x] Enrollment becomes active only when LMS sync_status = provisioned
- [ ] Reconciliation so an enrolled student cannot sit in confirmed + failed forever

## 3.2 Notifications
- [ ] lms_account_ready
- [ ] certificate_issued
- [ ] enrollment_confirmed
- [ ] In-app unread / read (read_at)
- [ ] Notification preferences

## 3.3 Audit logs
- [ ] Append-only log for enrollments, certificate issue/revoke, admin actions
- [ ] Actor, action, target, metadata
- [ ] No updates or deletes

---

# Phase 4 — Admin ops and hardening

## 4.1 Admin console
- [x] /admin/courses — review queue. Approve publishes. Send back keeps the draft and stores feedback.
- [ ] /admin/courses — archive and reassign from the admin console
- [ ] /admin/enrollments — search and repair bad records
- [ ] /admin/system-health — failed events, retry, reconcile
- [ ] /admin/users — accounts, roles, suspend/deactivate
- [ ] Audit log browser
- [ ] Basic reporting
- [ ] User status: active | suspended | deactivated (no hard delete)

## 4.2 Catalog discovery
- [x] Published course list
- [x] Search

Out of V1. No topic filters, sort, pagination, outcomes, or instructor profile.

## 4.3 Responsive and accessibility
- [x] Shared buttons, cards, fields, labels
- [x] Focus states, skip link, 44px controls, reduced motion
- [ ] QA at 375 / 768 / 1024 / 1440
- [ ] Keyboard-only + screen-reader names
- [ ] Contrast + 200% zoom
- [ ] Automated a11y checks in CI

## 4.4 Design system
- [ ] Empty-state and data-list components
- [ ] Storybook or equivalent
- [ ] Document responsive, content, and a11y rules
- [x] Update README (palette and routes match the app)
