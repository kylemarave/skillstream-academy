THESIS: The landing is the LMS category page: type-first offer, enroll→learn→certify in one view, Sign in as the only primary. It refuses metaphor worlds.
OWN-WORLD: Daylight laptop. Canvas #f8fafc, white panels, ink #0f172a, teal #0F766E. Source Sans 3. 8px radius, 1px slate lines, offset shadows. Path rail and form panels — not icon-tile grids.
STORY: A faculty evaluator sees the journey is real, planned V1 is labeled, and can sign in as a student or verify a certificate without an account.
FIRST VIEWPORT: Sticky How it works / Verify / Sign in (Verify on mobile). Headline left, three-step rail right, Sign in under the lede.
FORM: Category standard (canon) against Canvas, Moodle, Coursera. Seed key 4b6604bd. Signature: Sign in defaults to the student demo; the path rail lights Enroll first.
FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its provenance
